# DriverHigh  

**DriverHigh** is a high-performance web framework designed to build APIs that run as fast as possible. Built on the **Drive Framework**, it enforces parallelization of all independent processes, ensuring maximum efficiency and scalability.  

---

## Features  

- **Lightning-Fast API Execution**: Optimized for performance, forcing parallel execution wherever possible.  
- **Drive Framework Integration**: Leverages the powerful task orchestration of Drive Framework for seamless parallel processing.  
- **Developer-Friendly**: Guides developers to identify and parallelize tasks for maximum efficiency.  
- **Scalable Design**: Built for modern systems demanding high throughput and low latency.  
- **Dynamic Workflow Management**: Automatically identifies independent tasks and runs them concurrently.

## Installation  

To integrate **DriverHigh** into your project, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:  

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>id.levalapp.driverhigh</groupId>
    <artifactId>driverhigh</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Update your Maven dependencies:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Usage  

### Basic API Example  

Here’s how you can use **DriverHigh** to build an API:

```java
import id.levalapp.driverhigh.DriverHigh;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String result = new DriverHigh()
            .shift(() -> {
                System.out.println("Task 1: Independent process 1");
                return "Result 1";
            })
            .shift(() -> {
                System.out.println("Task 2: Independent process 2");
                return "Result 2";
            })
            .swift((result1, result2) -> {
                System.out.println("Combining results: " + result1 + " and " + result2);
                return "Final Output: " + result1 + ", " + result2;
            });

        System.out.println("Final Result: " + result);
    }
}
```

---

## Workflow  

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with a new `DriverHigh` instance.

2. **Shifting Independent Processes**:
   - Use `shift` to define all independent tasks.
   - Tasks execute in parallel whenever possible.

3. **Swift Finalization**:
   - Use `swift` to combine and process results from all parallel tasks.

---

## Output  

For the above example, the output will be:

```
Task 1: Independent process 1
Task 2: Independent process 2
Combining results: Result 1 and Result 2
Final Result: Final Output: Result 1, Result 2
```

## Why DriverHigh?  

DriverHigh enforces parallel execution to achieve unmatched performance in API development. By identifying and isolating independent processes, it ensures no task blocks another, maximizing throughput and minimizing latency.  

If you’re building APIs where speed is critical, **DriverHigh** is your ideal choice.
